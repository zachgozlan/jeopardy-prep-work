# jeopardy-prep-work
Notes and notebooks I used to train to compete on Jeopardy!, which I did on February 3rd, 2022.

See main write-up here: https://zachgozlan.github.io/jeopardy-prep-work/ (I am aware the date of the writeup is off by a year. I'll probably fix it at some point.)

Other files of note:
**jeopardy_prep_for_public.ipynb**, containing much of the code used to generate flashcards, self-assessment tests, category clustering, etc.
**denonyms.txt**, a pull of correct jeopardy answers through 2020 whose clues contained nationality names, which, yeah, lucky me, I got that on my board

If there's interest I'll upload a complete set of the "pavlovs" I created at a later date.
